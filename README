Install:          1.  Put code_complete.vim and my_snippets.template
                       to plugin directory.
                     2.  Use the command below to create tags file
                       including signature field.
                       ctags -R --c-kinds=+p --fields=+S .

 Usage:
                   hotkey:

                       "<A-d>" (default value of g:CodeCompl_Hotkey)
                       we DON'T use <tab>, because it comflict with
                       superstab.vim, you will quickly find Alt-S
                       will be a good choice.  Do all the jobs with
                       this key, see example:
                       press <A-d> after function name and (
                           foo ( <A-d>
                       becomes:
                           foo ( `<first param>`,`<second param>` )
                       press <A-D> after code template
                           if <A-d>
                       becomes:
                           if( `<...>` )
                           {
                               `<...>`
                           }


                   variables:

                       g:CodeCompl_Hotkey
                           the key used to complete function
                           parameters and key words. after you press
                           ths key AFTER you input the complete-word,
                           the word will be spreaded. you can see the
                           paragraph above for detail features.

                       g:CodeCompl_RegionStart g:CodeCompl_RegionEnd
                           region start and stop you can change them
                           as you like.  but you must be careful,
                           because we use them to detemin marks in
                           your template files(not complete file), so
                           if you change it, maybe you must
                           substitute all marks in your template
                           files. after you change them, maybe you
                           should update your template file, you can
                           use this command:
                           :UpdateTemplate<CR>

                       g:CodeCompl_Template_Forechar
                           you can use template file with
                           template-forechar, you can create a file
                           named 'complete-word.filetype',
                           and drop it in
                           g:CodeCompl_Template_Folder(default, it's
                           'templates' in your runtimepath, e.g.
                           D:\Vim\vimfiles\templates in windows, or
                           /root/.vim/templates in linux/unix.
                           after you create file, you can input
                           forechar + complete-word to include the
                           whole file. e.g. '#stdc' to include stdc.c
                           if your current filetype is 'c'.

                       g:CodeCompl_Template_Folder
                           see paragraph above. the folder default is
                           'templates'.

                       g:CodeCompl_Complete_File
                           file name of users defined snippets.  now
                           it named 'my_snippets.template', use this
                           postfix to prevent Vim load it
                           automatically

                       g:CodeCompl_ClearWhenUpdate
                           see the Option section

                       g:CodeCompl_SaveListInBuffer
                            Save complete list and template file list only in buffer


                   global helper functions:
                       
                       MakeRegion
                           same as g:CodeCompl_RegionStart . 'your
                           text' . g:CodeCompl_RegionEnd, but input a
                           little easily, but there are other helper
                           function and variables in your complete

                           file(defaults is my_snippets.template in
                           your plugin folder)

                   default complete-words:
                           see "my_snippets.template" file.
